# Sample apps from Choosing a JavaScript Framework

These are the (very, very) simple sample applications walked through
in Choosing a JavaScript Framework, from [Bleeding Edge Press](http://bleedingedgepress.com/our-books/choosing-javascript-framework/).

## Serve Files

If you need a web server, execute:

```
./serve
```

The files in this application will then be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) as long as the process is running;
`Ctrl-C` to kill the server.

> [Python](http://python.org) is required to run the server.

## Application Dependencies

Each framework's dependencies were installed via Bower.  For your convenience, these dependencies are under version control.

To modify the dependencies, you may wish to [install Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower).
